# Calculate
Calculate is a Arduboy math game based on the animated demo GIF of the game "B Math" from ABA games.

In this game, you see a sum with 5 answers underneath. With the left and right buttons you have to choose the correct answer. Then you confirm this with the Up or B button.
In the meantime, a clock is running back. If you get the answer right, you get half of the lost time back, if you get it wrong, the clock runs on. The game stops when the playing time is over.
